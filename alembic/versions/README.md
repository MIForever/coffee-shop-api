# Alembic Versions

This directory contains all the migration scripts generated by Alembic. Each script represents a set of changes to the database schema.

- Migration scripts are named with a revision hash and a description (e.g., `1975ea83b712_add_account.py`).
- Use `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"` to generate new migrations.

> Do not edit migration scripts manually unless necessary.
